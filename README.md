Successfully deployed a two-tier Flask application on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to ensure high availability, scalability, and ease of management.

Project Title: Two-ier Flask App Deployment on Amazon EKS

Project Description: Successfully deployed a two-tier Flask application on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to ensure high availability, scalability, and ease of management.

Technology Stack:

Flask Docker Kubernetes Helm Amazon EKS Containerization:

Created Docker containers for both the frontend and backend tiers of the Flask application. Utilized Docker Compose for local development and testing. Kubernetes Orchestration:

Set up and configured a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon EKS. Created deployment and service YAML files for both tiers, ensuring load balancing and high availability.

Helm Charts:

Developed Helm charts to package and deploy the Flask application, simplifying the deployment process. Customized Helm values and templates to accommodate the application's specific requirements.

Load Balancing and Scaling:

Implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of pods based on resource utilization. Utilized Kubernetes Ingress for traffic routing and load balancing.

Logging and Monitoring:

Integrated logging and monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time application performance monitoring. CI/CD Integration:

Integrated the project into a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate builds and deployments. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Utilized infrastructure as code principles to define and manage the EKS cluster and related resources. Security:

Implemented security best practices, including network policies, RBAC, and secrets management, to ensure the application's security. Version Control:

Managed the project using Git and maintained a version-controlled repository on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Collaboration:

Collaborated with a cross-functional team to ensure the successful deployment and operation of the application. Documentation:

Maintained comprehensive documentation for the project, including setup instructions and troubleshooting guides. Achievements:

Reduced deployment time by X% by implementing automation and infrastructure as code. Achieved X% increase in application availability and scalability. Ensured smooth migration of the Flask application from a monolithic architecture to a containerized, microservices-based architecture.
